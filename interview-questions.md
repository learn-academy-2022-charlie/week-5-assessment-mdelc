# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: A hash in Ruby is a block of code that can be accessed and reused.

  Researched answer: A Ruby hash is an object that can be created by assigning key/value pairs. They can somewhat be compared to an array but they use curly brackets. However, rather than having indexes to access the values inside it, the keys are used to obtain the data from the hashes. 



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is composed of code snippets used in Ruby.

  Researched answer: Gems are package from open source library that you can install on your system that has a specific purpose. It facilitates a more easy way of adding functionality without writing code. Each gem has its own name, version, and documentation. In class, we've been using RSpec and Rails most frequently. 



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails allows a smoother way to work with databases and your web app. 

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails allows a much easier and quicker way for creating web apps with tools for the front and backend. It's a web framework that provides default structure for code or databases being used. It can be used to update databases, render HTML templates, and ensuring the security of webpages from common attacks. 



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: Relational databases are databases that are connected to one another and can use the information from one to connect to the other. An example of the connection between the two would be the primary key of one being connected to another in form of foreign key. 

  Researched answer: A relational database is a collection of data tables that are stored and related to one another and can be accessed through queries. Within the tables, each row has unique identifier called a key while the columns have the data attributes which define a relationship. PostgreSQL was what we used in our class, but another common popular relational database is MySQL. 



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

 Your answer: Primary keys are the identifiers of unique data found in rows of databases. They are what's referenced to connect tables to one another in a relational database. 

  Researched answer: Primary keys must contain unique values for the rows of data individually (can't be null). The primary key acts as a unique identifier for each table record. The primary key is used to connect other database tables by a foreign key. 




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A set of naming pattern standards to make routes that can be reused and more efficiently. The routes map Get, Post, Patch, Delete HTTP methods and makes it easier to understand and work within the webapp. 

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation - Is in a universal format for sending structured data over network connection between the server and webapp. It can be used along with programming languages, but isn't a programming language itself. 

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby - templating language based on Ruby that looks like a plain text doc. ERB can recognize tags in the template and converts them on the rules.

4. Params: Params are parameters being passed in user browser. They are key-value pairs. Rails uses special syntax with hashes.  

5. API: Application Programming Interface - set of functions
